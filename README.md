# Distance Measurement between two Objects
Measuring the distance between two objects using Pythagorean Theorem and OpenCV. For object detection, YOLOv3 model is used in this project. Here, I have just traget only the person and dog to measure distance between them to developed the prototype for distance measurement on the basis of pythagoras formula.

    a^2 + b^2 = c^2

# Download the YOLOv3 Model
[Download file](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights) and save it into YOLOv3_model folder.
